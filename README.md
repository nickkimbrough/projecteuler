My Solutions to [ProjectEuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/)'s Problems. This repository will contain
spoilers to the first 100 questions, and is intended to show the methods I used
to come to the answers, in line with [Project Euler's Rules](https://projecteuler.net/about#publish).

## Running The Solutions

I have used VSCode as my editor of choice for all of the solutions posted here.
Certain languages require additional setup in order to run.

### C\#


1. Make sure you have the
[.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (2.1 minimum) installed.
2. Install the dotnet-script tool with the following command:
    - `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`
3. Ensure the path to the dll is correct in launch.json.
