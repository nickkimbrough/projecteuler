    Initial Thoughts:

    I think I'll need to write an efficient algorithm for checking the formula's
    values with a set of given inputs. Since there are 1000 variations of a and
    1001 variations of b, I think that means there are 1,001,000 different
    possible combinations here. n could grow to a very large number as well.

    My first attempt is going to be a brute force, but there may be some
    mathematical shortcuts that I could take here to eliminate some of the
    combinations that will arise after I start analyzing the data.
