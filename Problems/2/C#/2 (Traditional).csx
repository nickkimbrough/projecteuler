/** What I learned:
In C#, a for loop doesn't HAVE to have a condition section:

In math, Phi is used to specify the Golden ratio. It is (1+âˆš5)/2.
    The C# Math library doesn't contain a constant for this:

In the Fibonacci sequence, every third value is even due to the way the numbers
are added.

using System;

readonly double Phi = (1 + Math.Sqrt(5)) / 2;
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 3;; i+= 3)
{
    int value = (int)((Math.Pow(Phi, i) - (-Math.Pow(Phi, -i))) / Math.Sqrt(5));

    if (value > 4000000)
    {
        break;
    }

    sum += value;

Console.WriteLine(sum);
